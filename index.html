      <h4>Two quotes from Ray Bradbury:</h4>
      <h5 id="quote"><b>"You don't have to burn books to destroy a culture. Just get people to stop reading them."</b></h5>
        <br>
      
<h5 id="quote"><b>      
      "I see nothing but good coming from computers. When they first appeared on the scene, people were saying, 'Oh my God, I'm so afraid'. I hate people like that â€“ I call them the neo-Luddites"</b></h5>
